# 3.4-etsy-iteration
* In this project, I used functional iterators to mine a large dataset from Etsy. The objective was to familiarize myself with functional iterators like map, reduce, filter and forEach. The main.js file will show how I used those iterators to manipulate the data. You can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
